# hello-world
Just another repository 

Hello, I am Glavkos and I like learning languages both  human and  artificial. Also a translator on free-open source software, mostly localizing Mediawiki or  other builds  on translatewiki.net . Lately I developed a high interest in coding and programming languages, but I am not writing anything yet.
